'''PROBLEM STATEMENT:
It is the day of interview in a company and the chance is only for first 10 candidates. 
The receptionist has the duty of noting the name and degree of every candidate. She was using a register book so far
but wishes to switch this task to a computer operation. So, she requires your Python programming skills to make a
solution for her problem. 
You have to write a program to note the names and degree of candidates approaching.
Also, create a parallel database (file) in the local machine with this data. Bring out the best solution!

APPROACH:
We can use a Dictionary inorder to store the Name,degree of each candidate along with the time,because the chance is giving only to the first 10 candidates.
And parallely we will be writing the data in an other file.
'''
#SOLUTION:
from datetime import datetime
now=datetime.now()
#print(now.strftime("%d/%m/%y [%H:%M:%S]")) # to print the date and time in specified format
print("RECEPTIONIST IS SUPPOSSED TO TAKE ONLY FIRST 10 CANDIDATES")
dict={} #using a dictionary to store the details of Candidate
ppl=0 #As the number of people attending the interview in unknown,we will collect only the details of fisrt 10 Candidate

while(ppl<10):
    name=input("Enter name and degree:") #takes name,degree from user
    time=now.strftime(" %d/%m/%y [%H:%M:%S]")# the current time is stored here
    dict[name]=time# the values are put in dictionary
    '''and simultaneously we also insert the data in a doc file'''
    filewrite=name+"DATE:"+time #concatanate the input, to put  it into  the file
    filepath='C:/Users/Sahana R K/Desktop/sahana.doc'#path of file,where data is written
    with open(filepath,'a') as fhand: #opening the file in append mode to insert data
        fhand.write(filewrite) #writing contents into file
        fhand.write("\n")
    ppl=ppl+1
    
print("We have got the first 10 candidate details:\n")  
print("The Candidate details are :")    
print(dict)
